Text Recordings.

Record screencasts in plain text.

** Just an Idea
The idea is to create a tool that allows to record text somehow and then reproduce it just as you would reproduce a video.

** Some specifications

- It should have controls (play, pause, ffw, rew, stop, rec)
- It should have some kind of timestamp, so it can be synchronized with other resources
- The other resources:
  + Audio track
  + Video track
  + Browser extension (so, if you are recording the development of a web page, you could see in a browser the current snapshot of the page)
